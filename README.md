# Apps-of-Python_in_Bioinformatics
Various applications have been developed using the biopython library of the Python programming language. The functions that have been changed or removed with the new version of the Biopython library are discussed. The alternatives of these functions are explained in the files.

### For basic sequence implementations(Bio.Seq , Bio.Alphabet): [Bioinformatic App 1](https://github.com/mahirezuhalozdemir/Apps-of-Python_in_Bioinformatics/blob/main/bioinformaticApp1.py)
### For sequnce aligning implementations(Bio.Seq , Bio.Align): [Bioinformatic App 2](https://github.com/mahirezuhalozdemir/Apps-of-Python_in_Bioinformatics/blob/main/bioinformaticApp2.py)
### For global and local alignment with python(Without using any library): [Bioinformatic App 3](https://github.com/mahirezuhalozdemir/Apps-of-Python_in_Bioinformatics/blob/main/bioinformaticApp3.py)
